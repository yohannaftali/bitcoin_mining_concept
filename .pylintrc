# .pylintrc - project-local pylint configuration
# This minimal config disables the "broad-except" warning (W0703) so
# code in this educational project may catch general Exception where
# necessary for robustness or debugging.

[MASTER]
# Disable broad-except (W0703), missing function/method docstring (C0116), missing class docstring (C0115), and line-too-long (C0301).
# This allows catching general Exception and omitting docstrings in this educational prototype project.
disable=W0703,C0116,C0115,C0301

[FORMAT]
# Ignore line-too-long (C0301) by setting max line length to a high value
max-line-length=200

# You can extend this file with other pylint options as needed.
